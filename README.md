# Breast Cancer Detection from Scratch ü©∫üîç

Welcome to Breast Cancer Detection from Scratch! This is a machine learning project that uses Python to detect breast cancer from medical images.

## Overview üìù

This project uses the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) to train a machine learning model to classify tumors as either benign or malignant. The model is implemented from scratch in Python.
